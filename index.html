      <h2>Petrol and Diesel cars</h2>
      <p>Petrol and diesel cars each have their advantages and drawbacks. Petrol cars generally provide smoother acceleration, are quieter, and often have lower initial costs, making them appealing for everyday city driving. On the other hand, diesel cars tend to be more fuel-efficient, particularly for long-distance travel, and their engines are often more durable. However, diesel cars produce higher emissions of nitrogen oxides, contributing to air pollution, whereas petrol cars emit more carbon dioxide. Additionally, maintenance and repair costs for diesel engines can be higher. The choice between the two depends on the priorities of the driver, such as cost, performance, and environmental impact.</p>

      <h2>Hybrid cars</h2>
      <p>Hybrid cars combine a traditional internal combustion engine with an electric motor to offer improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions compared to conventional petrol or diesel vehicles. These vehicles can switch seamlessly between the two power sources or use them simultaneously, optimizing performance and energy consumption. Hybrid cars are ideal for city driving, as they often rely on their electric motor at lower speeds, reducing fuel use. However, they can be more expensive upfront and may require specialized maintenance. Despite these factors, hybrids are a popular choice for drivers seeking a balance between eco-friendliness and convenience.</p>

      <h2>Electric cars</h2>
      <p>Electric cars (EVs) are vehicles powered entirely by electricity, using rechargeable batteries instead of traditional fuel engines. They are highly efficient, produce zero tailpipe emissions, and significantly reduce the carbon footprint compared to petrol or diesel vehicles. EVs are cost-effective in the long run due to lower maintenance and energy costs, and they offer a quieter, smoother driving experience. However, they rely on charging infrastructure, which may be limited in certain areas, and their upfront cost can be higher. Despite these challenges, electric cars are becoming increasingly popular as a sustainable and innovative transportation choice.</p>
